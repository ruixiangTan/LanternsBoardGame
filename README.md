# LanternsBoardGame
The commandLine version of the online kickstarter project - Lanterns: The Harvest Festival.
Implemented all the rules from the official game rule book : http://foxtrotgames.com/lanterns.
Implemented a greedy AI using the greedy algorithme, based on a mathematical model, the AI should always choose the move that can maximize its scores.

The default players are two: you and the AI. "k" means black in the game.
